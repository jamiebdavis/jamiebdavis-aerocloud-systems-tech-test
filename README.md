# Introduction

Front end application that displays a list of hotels.
App has the ability to sort by hotel star rating and filter on hotel facilities.

# Testing

All testing is done through jest with enzyme. Tests check to see if components have render
(I would like to have added more testing but i react the 2 hour limit)

# What more i could of done

I would like to have added more testing and some javascript unit testing on some of the handlers. I would of also liked to have
added some more staying and transitions.

handleFacilitiesFilter needs reworking so it doens't just look for excat work matches.

Any questions please dont hesitate to contact me.
