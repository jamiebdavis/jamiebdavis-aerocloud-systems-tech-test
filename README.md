# Technical test for AeroCloud Systems

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App\
Time taken: 2hrs

# Dependancies

jest
enzyme
react-test-renderer
enzyme-adapter-react-16

# Introduction

Front end application that displays a list of hotels.
App has the ability to sort by hotel star rating and filter on hotel facilities.

# Testing

All testing is done through jest with enzyme. Tests check to see if components have rendered.

# What more i could of done

I would like to have added more testing on the components and some javascript unit testing on some of the handlers. I would of also liked to have added some more styling and transitioning.

handleFacilitiesFilter needs reworking so it doens't just look for exact word matches.

Any questions please dont hesitate to contact me.\
Kind Regards. \
